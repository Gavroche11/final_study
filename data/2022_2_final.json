        "**Core Principle of Endocrine Testing:** Endocrine testing is based on two fundamental concepts: **stimulation tests** are used to diagnose hormone deficiency, while **suppression tests** are used to diagnose hormone excess.",
        "**Stimulation Tests (for Hypofunction):** These tests assess the reserve capacity of a gland. A stimulus is administered that should provoke hormone release. A subnormal or absent response confirms glandular insufficiency.",
        "**Example - Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT):** This is the gold-standard stimulation test for assessing the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and Growth Hormone (GH) reserve.",
        "**ITT Mechanism:** Insulin is given to induce hypoglycemia (blood glucose <40 mg/dL). This profound physiologic stress should trigger a robust release of counter-regulatory hormones, including ACTH (leading to cortisol release) and GH.",
        "**ITT Interpretation:** Failure of cortisol or GH to rise to a predefined threshold (e.g., peak cortisol **>18 mcg/dL**) indicates adrenal insufficiency or GH deficiency, respectively.",
        "**Suppression Tests (for Hyperfunction):** These tests assess for autonomous (unregulated) hormone secretion. A substance is given that would normally inhibit hormone release. Failure to suppress indicates the gland is functioning independently of normal feedback mechanisms.",
        "**Example - Dexamethasone Suppression Test:** Used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome. Dexamethasone (a potent glucocorticoid) should suppress pituitary ACTH and thus adrenal cortisol production. Failure to suppress cortisol points to autonomous cortisol secretion.",
        "**Example - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test for Acromegaly:** A glucose load normally suppresses GH secretion. In acromegaly, the pituitary adenoma secretes GH autonomously, so GH levels fail to suppress (e.g., nadir GH remains **>1 ng/mL**).",
        "**Pitfalls:** Using a suppression test to work up a suspected deficiency; not recognizing contraindications to certain tests (e.g., ITT is contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders or coronary artery disease); misinterpreting test results without considering the clinical context."

        "**Pathophysiology Core:** The central mechanism is the activation of the **trigeminovascular system**.",
        "**Neurogenic Inflammation:** Activation of trigeminal nerve afferents innervating meningeal blood vessels causes the release of vasoactive neuropeptides like Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) and Substance P. This leads to vasodilation and dural plasma extravasation, a process known as neurogenic inflammation.",
        "**Peripheral Sensitization:** During a migraine attack, the persistent inflammatory stimulus makes the peripheral trigeminal nerve endings (nociceptors) in the meninges hypersensitive. This process lowers their pain threshold, causing normally innocuous stimuli, such as the pulsation of cranial arteries, to be perceived as intense, throbbing pain. This explains why the headache worsens with minor movements.",
        "**Central Sensitization:** If the attack is severe or prolonged, second- and third-order neurons in the brainstem (trigeminal nucleus caudalis) and thalamus can become sensitized. This leads to cutaneous allodynia, where non-painful stimuli on the skin of the head and neck are perceived as painful.",
        "**Aura vs. Headache:** The aura phase is thought to be caused by a wave of neuronal and glial depolarization called cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is associated with transient vasoconstriction.

        "**Pathophysiology:** The defective NCC impairs NaCl reabsorption in the DCT, effectively mimicking the chronic use of a thiazide diuretic. This leads to volume depletion, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and subsequent renal wasting of potassium and hydrogen ions.",

        "**Pathophysiology:** The Shiga toxin is absorbed into the bloodstream and damages endothelial cells, particularly in the renal glomeruli.
