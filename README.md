```json
{
  "doc": {
    "source": "exam_name.pdf",
    "pages_parsed": 10,
    "has_global_answer_key": true
  },
  "defaults": {
    "depth": "shallow"
  },
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_no": "1",
      "depth": "deep",
      "answer": {
        "label": "3",
        "text": "Answer text"
      },
      "why": ["Reason 1", "Reason 2"],
      "others": [
        {
          "label": "1",
          "text": "Option text",
          "reason": "Rejection reason"
        }
      ],
      "findings": ["Finding 1", "Finding 2"],
      "runner_up": "2",
      "flags": {
        "illegible": false,
        "mixed_lang": false
      },
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "rethink": {
        "mismatch": false,
        "first_guess": "3",
        "provided_key": {"label": "3"},

## Key Features

### Streamlined Design

The application focuses on efficient exam solution review with:
- **Simple file management**: Upload multiple files and switch between them
- **Clean detail view**: No clutter, just the essential information
- **Smart layout**: Findings positioned between Why and Distractors for logical flow
- **Compact formatting**: Reduced vertical spacing for faster reading
- **Automatic mismatch detection**: Highlights when AI changed its decision

## Troubleshooting

### Schema Validation Errors

If you see "Invalid JSON schema" errors:
1. Ensure your JSON has a `questions` array
2. Each question must have `question_no` and `answer` fields
3. Check the example schema above

### No Files Uploaded

1. Click "Browse files" in the sidebar
2. Select one or more JSON files
3. Files will load automatically

### Navigation Issues
